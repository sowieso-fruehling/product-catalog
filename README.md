# Product catalog

REST API enabling product manipulation

### How to use the app

The API is protected with JWT token. To use the api you can use long living JWT: 

`Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VybmFtZSIsImV4cCI6NDcxNDkyNDAwOSwiaWF0IjoxNTYxMzI0MDA5fQ.U6arTWzxzu-Fl2AhLEloYBZ8wNdHPqUu1ffWjQp6vnSc36dOoRLLyggO7KdvNPGbnLxlKQbXbRzbCtMc5eleqA`

It was not requirement, but this application can also generate tokens for you. After you start your app either by docker or locally, to get valid token just execute the script: 

`./scripts/get-jwt-token.sh`

In real life scenarios this is not good microservices design and this functionality of providing tokens should be responsibility of another microservice, but for simplicity I kept it here

With either of this tokens you'll be able to make API calls

Best you start with batch import of products. The script

`batch-import-products.sh`

will import 100 products for you ( or more, if you run it more times). From that point on, you have following endpoints:

`GET /catalog-api/v1/products` - to get all products, default pagination is 20. This endpoint accepts different request parameters so you can search by title, description, sort, define pagination ( number of records per page, or pick specific page). Here are some examples of endpoints for this:

```
GET /catalog-api/v1/products?size=50 - get first page with 50 records 
GET /catalog-api/v1/products?page=1&sort=brand,desc - get second page, with default 20 records and sorted by brand, descending
GET /catalog-api/v1/products?page=1&size=5 - get second page with 5 records
GET /catalog-api/v1/product/2 - get product with id=2
GET /catalog-api/v1/products?description=Description 3 - get products having description property equal to "Description 3"
GET /catalog-api/v1/products?title=Title 1&description=Description 1 - get products having title=Jacket 1 and description=Description 1

POST /catalog-api/v1/products - to batch create products. It's what /script/batch-import-products.sh does
POST /catalog-api/v1/product - to create one product

PUT /catalog-api/v1/product/1 - to override a product with id=1, or if there is no product with this id, to create a new one with first available id

PATCH /catalog-api/v1/product/1 - to partially update product with id=1

DELETE /catalog-api/v1/product/1 - to delete product with id=1
```

### How to run the service locally

Open terminal and go to project's home directory

To start the app run:

`./gradlew bootRun`

### Run as docker container

You can get already built docker image from dockerhub by executing:

`docker pull milospajic/catalog-service:gfg`

If you want to build it yourself, then please open terminal and go to project's home directory. To create docker image run:

`./scripts/create-docker-image.sh`

to run this image, execute:

`./scripts/run-docker-image.sh`

If you're having slower machine, it can take a while for the container to start, also image creation can timeout, in which case you should execute the script again, or download the one from dockerhub

To stop your container, you can do ctrl+c

### How to run the tests locally

In terminal, in project's home directory execute: 
`./gradlew test`
